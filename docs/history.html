            <p>The Internets existence is rather young, only being around for a little less than half-a-century.</p>
            <p>
                And it all started with a group of bright scientists.

                Around the late 1960s to early 70s, bright computer scientists, such as Robert E. Kahn and Vint Cerf, managed to invent the very first interconnected network, ARPANET.
                From there on, they began creating and using new forms to transmit data more efficiently and safely, such as the TCP/IP, and thus leading to quick
                advancements to this interconnected band of networks.

            <p>
                The World Wide Web was not far ahead either, being created by Tim Berners-Lee only 20 years later around 1990. The World Wide Web made
                accessing the internet much more common to the public, and because of this, allowed the WWW along with the internet itself to nearly explode
                in popularity. Thanks to websites, hyperlinks, and URLs, the World Wide Web provided a significant boost to the internet. Without it, the internet and the consumer would be
                in an extremely different place.
