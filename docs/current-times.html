            <p class="mt-3">
                The most common form of connection to the internet is through cable, such as ethernet, with wireless connections right behind. Nearly every household and business uses cable
                to access the web, and there is a very good chance that you are using it as well. If you're not using it however, you may be using fiber optic cable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fiber optics has been around for a long time, much longer than the widespread network we use constantly. However, recent upgrades to the fiber optics has allowed
                these cables to become much more efficient than traditional cables. Providing higher bandwidth, allowing more data to be transmitted with said transmissions
                being more reliable due to reduced interference. This is all thanks to the nature of fiber optics: Using light to transmit data rather than electricity.
            </p>
            <p>
                But none of these developments and improvements will stop. In the coming years, new advancements will surface and changes will happen. One such may include
                a more automatic and permanent way to connect to the internet, creating a sort of "Universal Internet". Leading to the removal of individual connections that uses
                WiFi passwords. And because of these rapid changes, businesses will go out if they do not adapt quickly to the ever accelerating rate of technology.
